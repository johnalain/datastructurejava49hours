A LeetCode-compatible Java solution is a Java code 
snippet that you can copy and paste directly 
into the LeetCode editor — and it will compile 
and run successfully without any modifications.

LeetCode provides a pre-defined environment, which means:

You don’t include a 
public static void main(String[] args) method.

You don’t use Scanner or any input prompts 
(System.out.print(...)).

You only define a class named Solution with one or 
more public methods that solve the problem.

LeetCode automatically runs your method with different 
inputs during testing.

OneCompiler is an IDE online but you can't 
run java without main method you need leetcode for that
